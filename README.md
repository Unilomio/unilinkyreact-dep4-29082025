# 🔗 Unilinky: The Ultimate Bio-Link

## 💡 What is Unilinky?

**Unilinky** is a sleek, modern bio-link page designed to be your all-in-one digital hub. It’s a single, powerful link that connects your audience to everything you do, from your social media profiles to your latest blog posts and projects.

Think of it as your digital business card: a centralized space where you can manage and share all your important links gracefully.

## 🧱 About the HTML Version

This version of Unilinky is a **single, self-contained HTML file**. It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, making it highly customizable without needing a separate CSS file.

It’s ready to deploy on any web host. Just upload the file and you’re good to go!

## ⚛️ About the React Version

My React version of Unilinky takes the same core concepts and I built upon them with a **component-based architecture**. This would make it easier to add dynamic features like:

- A database to manage your links
- An admin panel for easy editing
- A clean, modern codebase that scales with your needs

# 🌟 Unilomio: A little help for the lonely journey

Hey there, I'm **Rashika**! 👋

I'm just a solo founder who's been there. Late nights fueled by ☕ coffee, staring at the code, and wondering if any of it is even worth it. The truth is, building something from scratch can feel incredibly lonely. I know what it's like to struggle, to feel like you're the only one going through it. 😔

That's why I started **Unilomio** 💜. I didn't just want to build plugins; I wanted to build lifelines. A small, simple tool that could take one thing off another founder's plate so they could focus on what truly matters. It's my way of reaching out and saying, _"You're not alone in this."_ 🤗

## 🎯 Why Unilomio?

It's a lifesaver for founders who want to showcase their products in a new, engaging way. You can easily add beautiful, interactive 3D visualizations to your website without spending a ton of time or money on complex development. It's all about making your life easier and helping you tell your product's story more effectively. ✨

## 💸 Pricing Philosophy

My plugins are super cheap, and some are even **FREE** 🎁. The small charge is really just for sustenance, to keep the lights on and the code flowing. It's enough to help me keep going so I can keep helping others.

## 💖 A Personal Note

The work I do is deeply personal, a piece of my own journey. So, while I'm thrilled you're using it 🎉, I'd really appreciate it if you respected my [licensing terms](https://licensing.unilomio.in). It means a lot to me that you respect the effort and heart poured into this. 🙏

## 🆘 Need Help?
